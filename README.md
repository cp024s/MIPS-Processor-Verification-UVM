# 16 bit MIPS Processor Verification using UVM
The MIPS processor design represents a fundamental milestone in the evolution of contemporary processor architectures, integrating key concepts like Pipelining, Data Dependency handling, and Forwarding to enhance processing capabilities and speed.


## Project Overview
This project aims to verify the functionality of a five-stage pipelined MIPS processor. The processor features 16 instructions with 49 variants, 5 pipeline stages, and an integrated hazard unit. 
The verification process employs advanced techniques, including Constrained Random Verification for assessing individual instruction functionality and Assertion Based Verification to validate data dependencies managed by the hazard unit. 
The entire verification process is implemented using the System Verilog Unified Verification Methodology (UVM).


## Design Specifications
The MIPS processor under scrutiny is a 16-bit, five-staged pipelined processor, providing 16 instructions with 49 variations. The verification process follows a two-step approach: 
first, the sequential verification of individual blocks within each stage, and second, the validation of the overall functionality of the design. 
Automation is leveraged to streamline verification, utilizing a single testing system with interfaces to internal and main input-output blocks. 
This approach ensures a highly automated, rapid, and accurate verification process.


## Design Under Test
The design comprises the following five stages:
1. **Instruction Fetch:** This stage houses all instructions slated for execution and includes a program counter to indicate the current instruction in progress.

2. **Decode Stage:** Responsible for simplifying instructions and coordinating processor operations through various control signals, this stage also accommodates general-purpose registers for runtime data storage.

3. **Execution Stage:** This stage executes arithmetic and logical instructions.

4. **Memory Access:** Featuring the memory unit, this stage serves as the primary data memory storage for the processor.

5. **Write Back:** The final stage involves writing data back to the appropriate register in the register file after completing operations.


## Instruction set
The MIPS processor design encompasses a diverse instruction set, offering a range of operations to facilitate varied computational tasks. The instructions are categorized based on their functionality, and each instruction specifies its type, opcode, 
control signals, reconfiguration, destination register, source registers, and memory operations. Below is a brief overview of the MIPS processor's instruction set:

signals. In the given table we show only the internal signals which carry the data most relevant to our testing.

## Verification functionality and test cases
The verification plan outlined in the given context involves a systematic approach to validate the MIPS processor design. The plan is divided into two main parts:

1. **Data Independent Instruction Testing:**
   - **Objective:** Verify individual instructions for functionality.
   - **Method:** Constrained Random Verification (CRV).
   - **Process:**
     - Test each instruction separately.
     - Utilize CRV to cover various scenarios for each instruction.
     - Assess the functionality by checking if the output aligns with expected results.
   - **Challenges and Considerations:**
     - Testing individual instructions may not capture data dependencies.
     - Automation and efficiency are key to streamline testing.

2. **Data Dependent Instruction Testing:**
   - **Objective:** Verify instructions with data dependencies.
   - **Method:** Assertion Based Verification (ABV).
   - **Process:**
     - Identify instructions with data dependencies (e.g., MOV, LOAD, STORE).
     - Design test cases to check proper handling of data dependencies.
     - Use assertions to validate correct execution of data-dependent instructions.
   - **Challenges and Considerations:**
     - Data dependencies require careful handling.
     - ABV ensures specific scenarios are tested to validate the hazard unit's functionality.
